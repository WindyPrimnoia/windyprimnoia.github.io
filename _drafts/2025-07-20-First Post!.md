Hello, world! This is my first time blogging~
My name is WindyPompom, aka Windy Primnoia. 
I love gamedev and world building. My dream is to become a solo gamedev ‚ú®

A little bit more about me:
- Currently Learning 2D & 3D Art + GameDev
- A backend Software Dev, and a lifelong Teacher. I taught highschool math and physics 'w')b
- I love sharing Memes and Yume on social media
- I like playing Games. Any co-op games like Helldivers 2
- I have many Original Characters

As of now, I have two Original Characters (will update if more are announced):
- ‚ôÄÔ∏èüî∑ Clarissa Pluie
- ‚ôÄÔ∏èüîº Vivi Meiritan


I will post :
- My project/gamedev
- My Original Character 
- 3d/2d art learning
- Life lesson and teaching method (I'm a teacher, been teaching since 2015)
- Some Psychology 
- And many more~


I hope I can bring the light to the world, even just one bit ‚ú®
